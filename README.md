# NeuralTest

This repository holds scripts that was written by me for my Undergraduate Research Project on Solving Inverse Function Problem in Automatic Software Testing Tool. 

One of the core interest of our research group is on Software Testing Tool and the project can be found [here](https://github.com/sunjun-group/Ziyuan). This project will leveraged on Generative Adversary Network (GAN) to improve existing methodology used by our research group in automatic software testing tool.

GANs are a type of artificial intelligence algorithms used in unsupervised machine learning, implemented by a system of two neural networks competing against each other in a zero-sum game framework. They were first introduced by Ian Goodfellow et al. in 2014. The research paper for GAN can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf).
